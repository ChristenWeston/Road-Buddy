Name of Student: 
* Christen Weston

Name of Project:
* Road Buddy

Project's Purpose or Goal: 
* Create a road trip planner including a map to plot destinations, APIs to search for places to eat and stop at along your route, and more! This will also be a chance to learn about TypeScript.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: 
* An interactive single paged application with a map and fields to enter your beginning and ending destination. 

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific: 
* Google Maps API
* TypeScript
* React and Redux
* Atlas Obscura API
* Yelp API or something similar to find places to eat

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific. : 
* I will spend time building out additional features like the ability to see your destination and on route stops in a list and potentially export that list, customizing the look of the map and overriding Google Map defaults, look in to using ESRIs Map API, utilizing Modals, creating sign ins for users and saving their trips, having template trips folks can choose from and build off of, utilizing fun graphics packages, building my own API to use with the application, and end-to-end testing with Cypress and/or Selenium.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* ESRI Map API
* A library to export to .csv
* Map customization library
* Authentication
* A database
* Graphics packages
* Cypress
* Selenium

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
* There will probably be a cat theme as well [^._.^]ï¾‰
